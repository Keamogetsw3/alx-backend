# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

## Description
This project involves building a queuing system in JavaScript using Redis, Kue, NodeJS, and ExpressJS. The project is designed to give you hands-on experience working with Redis as a message broker and job queue system. By the end of this project, you'll have a basic understanding of how to use Redis and Kue in Node.js to manage job queues and perform asynchronous operations.

## Tech Stack
- **Back-end**: JavaScript (ES6)
- **Database/Queue**: Redis
- **NodeJS Framework**: ExpressJS
- **Queue Library**: Kue (Deprecated but still in use)

## Project Timeline
- **Start Date**: Dec 2, 2024 6:00 AM
- **End Date**: Dec 5, 2024 6:00 AM

## Resources
- **Redis Quick Start**
- **Redis Client Interface**
- **Redis Client for NodeJS**
- **Kue Deprecated but Still Use in the Industry**

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- How to run a Redis server on your machine
- How to perform simple operations with the Redis client
- How to use a Redis client with NodeJS for basic operations
- How to store hash values in Redis
- How to deal with async operations using Redis
- How to use Kue as a queue system
- How to build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server
- How to build a basic Express app interacting with both a Redis server and a queue
